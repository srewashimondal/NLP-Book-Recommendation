              "29  in april 1992, a discovery was made that changed the way we view the world. dr. george smoot, a distinguished cosmologist and adventurer whose quest for cosmic knowledge had taken him from the brazilian rain forest to the south pole, unveiled his momentous discovery, bringing to light the very nature of the universe. for anyone who has ever looked up at the night sky and wondered, for anyone who has ever longed to pull aside the fabric of the universe for a glimpse of what lies behind it. wrinkles in time is the story of smoot's search to uncover the cosmic seeds of the universe.wrinkles in time is the double helix of cosmology, an intimate look at the inner world of men and women who ask. \"why are we here?\" it tells the story of george smoot's dogged pursuit of the cosmic wrinkles in the frozen wastes of antarctica, on mountaintops, in experiments borne aloft aboard high-altitude balloons, u-2 spy planes, and finally a space satellite. wrinkles in time presents the hard science behind the structured violence of the big bang theory through breathtakingly clear, lucid images and meaningful comparisons. scientists and nonscientists alike can follow with rapt attention the story of how, in a fiery creation, wrinkles formed in space ultimately to become stars, galaxies, and even greater delicate structures. anyone can appreciate the implications of a universe whose end is written in its beginnings - whose course developed according to a kind of cosmic dna, which guided the universe from simplicity and symmetry to ever-greater complexity and structure. as controversial as it may seem today, wrinkles in time reveals truths that, in an earlier century, would have doomed its proclaimers to the fiery stake. for four thousand years some people have accepted the genesis account of cosmic origin; for most of this century, scientists debated two rival scientific explanations known as the steady state and big bang theories. and now, wrinkles in time tells what really happened. the personal story behind astrophysicist george smoot's incredible discovery of the origin of the cosmos, hailed by stephen hawking as \"the scientific discovery of the century, if not of all time.\"   \n",
